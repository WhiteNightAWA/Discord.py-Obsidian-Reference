> ## Note
> This module uses the Python logging module to log diagnostic and errors in an output independent way. If the logging module is not configured, these logs will not be output anywhere. See [Setting Up Logging](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/logging.html#logging-setup) for more information on how to set up and use the logging module with discord.py.
